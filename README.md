# dojo-json-viewer

Using pure Vanilla JS...

We want to develop a little page that displays a JSON structure in a nice and friendly way.
The page shows an input field where the user can enter the URL of the JSON structure.
The page then displays an array with 3 columns.
The first column contains the key.
The second column shows a preview of the value depending on its type:
- String : shows the first 10 characters
- Array : shows the size of the array
- Object : shows the number of keys
The third column contains the type (string, array, object).
The array will only show the 10 first keys in the alphabetic order.
